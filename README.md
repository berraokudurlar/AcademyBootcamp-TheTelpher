**Game Name:** 

The Telpher

<br/>

**Game Synopsis:** 

One friend. One telpher. One good date. Taking your close friend Bella to ride the telphers in front of your university is all you need. How difficult could it be, really? 

<br/>

**Game Description:** 

The Telpher is a slice-of-life 2D visual novel developed with the Unity Engine. It is a simple game based on spending time with the main character’s friend, Bella, with one particular date spot being the purpose of the game: The telphers that lead to the mountain in front of their university. As Bella idealizes the spot and procrastinates on the task due to anxiety, the promised telpher date either gets delayed or ends up completely unsatisfactory on the player’s part. Will the player and Bella actually get a satisfactory conclusion?

The Telpher follows a monochromatic aesthetic, using backgrounds that resemble Japanese mangas, as well as cutscenes that resembles manga panels, along with black-and-white silhouettes. It is an earnest attempt at being a true visual novel, instead of being seen as a “deconstruction” of visual novels. Although it might be unsettling at times, there are no twist or serious horror elements in the game, and it stays as a heartfelt slice-of-life story until the very end.

**Notes to the Jury:**

This project was developed by one person, and the development also started fairly late. The reason behind these decisions will be explained in Sprint 1 & 2 segments of the document.  
While visual novels are definitely not complicated to make compared to a 3D competitive game, the restraints of writing a narrative game from the scratch without any other programmer to integrate the code or a designer to work on the sprites and backgrounds were definitely serious challenges that needs to be recognized. 

<br/>

**Marketing Plan:**


The Telpher is mostly a passion project that is meant for a more intimate audience. However, that does not mean it would be impossible to advertise and there are no intentions for it. Realistically, The Telpher’s market is a niche and yet loyal audience that prioritizes sincerity in the visual novel medium. Therefore, the sincerity of The Telpher as a true visual novel, rather than a “deconstruction” would be a stand out marketing point. Another realistic strategy is spreading the game through word of mouth by using the resemblance of many similar games, from “Doki Doki Literature Club” to “Slay the Princess”, or “Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk”.

The game will continue to be developed in the future, with more features that would fully utilize the Unity Game Engine, more branches, and possibly by adopting a 90’s pixel art aesthetic, such as the game Tokimeki Memorial.

**Sprint 1 & 2:**

As this solo-development project was allowed as of 08.07.2025, there was technically no “Sprint 1” between the dates of 20.06.2025-06.07.2025 for The Telpher. For that time being, I was the Product Owner of Team 44, and also handled some of the Scrum Master responsibilities. However, due to inactivity and imbalance of responsibility within the team, I was allowed to continue as a solo developer for the rest of the bootcamp. As someone who has unofficially handled the Product Owner role for the Ideathon and GameJam events, this was an unfortunate chain of events.

After finalizing the process, I have decided that the game I would work on would be “The Telpher”. The medium of visual novel was selected as it contains some fundamental elements such as saving and loading mechanics, as well as the dialogue system that I would definitely need to implement for future projects, and it would also mean that I could use my strongest skill: writing. Another important factor behind this decision was assets. 3D games and isometric 2D games with extremely polished ideas are not easy to implement without designers. 

For the pointing system, 100 points were decided, since this is the grading system most commonly used. 40 points would be for the narrative, 30 points would be for the programming, and 30 points would be for the art and creative direction. The narrative was given the most points, because visual novels are a medium that we both attribute the verbs “read” and “play” at the same time. 

For this sprint, the decision was completing 20 points of narrative, 20 points of programming, and 10 points of art and creative direction. 

In the case of visual novels, the same mechanics will be implemented to every corner of the game, so having a skeleton is essential. Therefore, I have focused on having a dialogue system, changeable scenes, dialogue choices, interactivity features, save & load system, main menu and the credits for the programming. 

For the narrative choice, I have decided to implement the prologue of the game, and the true ending of the game. This would allow me to have one finished linear story, in case other routes or alternatives wouldn’t come around. Therefore, the prologue and epilogue were the most important parts of the game. 

For the art and creative direction, a few backgrounds were edited and decided. I have also chose to not give characters any definitive forms within Bootcamp, as I’d prefer to commission a real artist who can create accurate designs and emotions. Generative AI was not suitable for the game’s current artistic vision. 

For task management, Asana was used. 

For the game’s story, a popular industry tool called “Twine” was used, as it allows writers to choose where the story branches.
