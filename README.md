## **Game Name:** 

The Telpher.

<br/>

## **Game Synopsis:** 

One friend. One telpher. One good date. Taking your close friend Bella to ride the telphers in front of your university is all you need. How difficult could it be, really? 

<br/>

## **Game Description:** 

The Telpher is a slice-of-life 2D visual novel developed with the Unity Engine. It is a simple game based on spending time with the main character’s friend, Bella, with one particular date spot being the purpose of the game: The telphers that lead to the mountain in front of their university. As Bella idealizes the spot and procrastinates on the task due to anxiety, the promised telpher date either gets delayed or ends up completely unsatisfactory on the player’s part. Will the player and Bella actually get a satisfactory conclusion?

The Telpher follows a monochromatic aesthetic, using backgrounds that resemble Japanese mangas, as well as cutscenes that resembles manga panels, along with black-and-white silhouettes. It is an earnest attempt at being a true visual novel, instead of being seen as a “deconstruction” of visual novels. Although it might be unsettling at times, there are no twist or serious horror elements in the game, and it stays as a heartfelt slice-of-life story until the very end.

<br/>

## **Notes to the Jury:**

This project was developed by one person, and the development also started fairly late. The reason behind these decisions will be explained in Sprint 1 & 2 segments of the document.  

While visual novels are definitely not complicated to make compared to a 3D competitive game, the restraints of writing a narrative game from the scratch without any other programmer to integrate the code or a designer to work on the sprites and backgrounds were definitely serious challenges that needs to be recognized. 

<br/>

## **Marketing Plan:**


The Telpher is mostly a passion project that is meant for a more intimate audience. However, that does not mean it would be impossible to advertise and there are no intentions for it. Realistically, The Telpher’s market is a niche and yet loyal audience that prioritizes sincerity in the visual novel medium. Therefore, the sincerity of The Telpher as a true visual novel, rather than a “deconstruction” would be a stand out marketing point. Another realistic strategy is spreading the game through word of mouth by using the resemblance of many similar games, from “Doki Doki Literature Club” to “Slay the Princess”, or “Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk”.

The game will continue to be developed in the future, with more features that would fully utilize the Unity Game Engine, more branches, and possibly by adopting a 90’s pixel art aesthetic, such as the game Tokimeki Memorial. 

<br/>

## **Sprint (1 &) 2:**

As this solo-development project was allowed as of 08.07.2025, there was technically no “Sprint 1” between the dates of 20.06.2025-06.07.2025 for The Telpher. For that time being, I was the Product Owner of Team 44, and also handled some of the Scrum Master responsibilities. However, due to inactivity and imbalance of responsibility within the team, I was allowed to continue as a solo developer for the rest of the bootcamp. As someone who has unofficially handled the Product Owner role for the Ideathon and GameJam events, this was an unfortunate chain of events.

After finalizing the process, I have decided that the game I would work on would be “The Telpher”. The medium of visual novel was selected as it contains some fundamental elements such as saving and loading mechanics, as well as the dialogue system that I would definitely need to implement for future projects, and it would also mean that I could use my strongest skill: writing. Another important factor behind this decision was assets. 3D games and isometric 2D games with extremely polished ideas are not easy to implement without designers. 

For the pointing system, 100 points were decided, since this is the grading system most commonly used. 40 points would be for the narrative, 30 points would be for the programming, and 30 points would be for the art and creative direction. The narrative was given the most points, because visual novels are a medium that we both attribute the verbs “read” and “play” at the same time. 

For this sprint, the decision was completing 20 points of narrative, 20 points of programming, and 10 points of art and creative direction. 

In the case of visual novels, the same mechanics will be implemented to every corner of the game, so having a skeleton is essential. Therefore, I have focused on having a dialogue system, changeable scenes, dialogue choices, interactivity features, save & load system, main menu and the credits for the programming. 

For the narrative choice, I have decided to implement the prologue of the game, and the true ending of the game. This would allow me to have one finished linear story, in case other routes or alternatives wouldn’t come around. Therefore, the prologue and epilogue were the most important parts of the game. 

For the art and creative direction, a few backgrounds were edited and decided. I have also chose to not give characters any definitive forms within Bootcamp, as I’d prefer to commission a real artist who can create accurate designs and emotions. Generative AI was not suitable for the game’s current artistic vision. 

For task management, Asana was used:

_(Backlog is divided to according to the "project management", "programming", and "creative direction" segments. Project management parts carry no weight in the grading system.)_

<br/>

For the game’s story, a popular industry tool called “Twine” was used, as it allows writers to choose where the story branches:

## **Sprint (1 &) 2 Review:**

•	The development with the current dialogue system is technically doable, but it is so "foolproof" that it is not really practical or suitable for a longer narrative. It will be scrapped for a better system that uses JSON files, and the save & load functionality will be based around it, so it is currently untouched. 

•	The time and resources are unfortunately limited. The scope of the game, the choices, and the endings unfortunatelly need to be narrowed down. In the future versions, the choices will be so delicate that unlike many visual novels, always making the "right choices" and saying the "right things" will give Bella the impression of being fake, causing the frendship to be broken. However, such features can be only added after the bootcamp. 

•	Although the epilogue needs to be expanded, the only milestone that wasn't achieved is technically the save and load functions, and it was because they were benched. 40 points were completed for this sprint. 

•	For the next sprint, a new and more efficent dialogue system will be implemented, probably through Inkle, and the dialogues will be engrained to the new system after getting finished. Save and load functions will be added, as well as the load screen and journal screen for the main menu. The main menu texts will have new animations. A few new backgrounds will be added. 

•	Although more could be done for the project, it was decided that the time limitations both caused by the sprint 1 delay and scheduling conflicts occurring in real life wouldn't make more features possible. 

<br/>

## **Sprint (1 &) 2 Retrospective:**

•	The concept, plot and a prototype aesthetic theme for the project were designed and decided.

•	Prologue was written, the story was planned.

•	A splash screen, a rolling credits screen, and a main menu were added with their functionalities and proper scene managements. 

•	The skeleton of the visual novel was programmed, but it will be improved. Currently it has the textbox, character name box, the animation for letters, a working dialogue system, backgrounds, a few simple background animations, music for every scene, and a character sprite.

•	The icon of the game is added. 


<br/>

## **Sprint 3:**

<br/>

Due to foreseen circumstances, (as the solo developer, I was starting an internship in a different city), unfortunately the development was very staggering for this sprint. Using the same metric for the pointing system, 25 points were completed for this sprint, which was not enough to add one of the most vital features such as the CG gallery and save & load features. Why there is a proper scenario that can be experienced by the player, it is definitely very lackluster as a visual novel.

<br/>

<br/>

The task sheet for the Sprint 3, which was made as a separate Asana board can be seen.

<br/>

A definitive challenge for this sprint was building the game and making sure everything was displayed properly. There were many problems that were caused by anchoring features in the Canvas, and making sure that every element works properly in the screen when the game is built was my utmost priority. This required adjustments to the all scenes built. 

The goal for this sprint was having the miniature version of what I intended as the story for The Telpher. I wanted to include a proper splash screen, main menu, story with all the elements done right, credits, with all of them looking proper and professional. As a "miniature" version, it is actually completed and working.

<br/>

Here are videos from the current development. They are a bit blurry here because of my uploading style, but they are HD within the game.

For the dialogue system, it uses many hard-coded cases, which is not the most efficient, but I still believe that I restructured everything in a way that is easier to put new dialogues and even choice buttons.

<br/>

## **Sprint 3 Review:** 

•	This sprint was a bit fruitless and while a product was provided in bare minimum, it needed more development time. The lack of Sprint 1 was felt the most compared to the Sprint 2. 

•	On the other hand, I learned how it feels like to be a solo-developer, and what are the hardships encountered. Despite the unfinished product, I definitely think that I tried my best and learned a lot in the process.

•	The development of The Telpher will be continued, and this Bootcamp thankfully allowed the opportunity for its initialization. 

•	Taking inspiration from the game NEEDY STREAMER OVERLOAD, the engine will remain as Unity, as it provides more flexibility and features compared to a visual novel engine such as RenPy. GameMaker might be another option for the future if the style of the game changes, but it is undecided.

•	The features that will be added are the ones discussed in the Sprint 1 & 2, allowing the player to come up with their name while keeping "Nora" as the canon name, adding more delicate choices that will use a secret stat system, making cutscenes, adding a map to wander around the city, adding phone messages feature with some of the story happening through texting, possibly hiring artists for the sprites and backgrounds.  



<br/>

## **Sprint 3 Retrospective:**

•	Prologue was finalized, epilogue was properly written and expanded, both were edited and the story was integrated into the visual novel. 

•	The splash screen, rolling credits screen, and the main menu were polished, mostly aesthetically. 

•	Two episodes of the visual novel were finalized and built, which provides a full and concrete experiences.

•	All of the UI was polished in a way that the built game works properly.

•	Some of the functionality goals set in Sprint 2 were unfortunately not met due to scheduling conflicts that mostly involved an internship.
